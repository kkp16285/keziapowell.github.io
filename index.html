	<div style=width:1650px><H2>3 Reasons Why Interpreting Is A Good Career Choice</H2>
<p>1. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Interpreters are valuable in that they allow communication and understanding to take place where it otherwise would not.</span> </p>
<p><IMG src= "interpreter.jpg" alt="text sample" STYLE = "float:right" height="220" width="210"> The hearing and speech impaired use interpreters to communicate with people who do not have these impairments and vice versa. Countries need to communicate with each other even when they do not speak the same language. Travelers and immigrants need interpreters in airports and hospitals to help others understand their needs and aid themsleves in understanding the new world around them. Although interpreters may not directly affect the everyday life of many people, they make a big difference to those who around them. Such interpreters can be found throughout history, each doing things that cause them to be remembered ceturies later.</p>
<p>2. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Interpreters, or just bilinguals in general, are not confined to any one job market.</span> </p>
<p> <IMG src= "interpreting.jpeg" alt="text sample" STYLE = "float:right" height="150" width="240">If they have no job opportunities in the country of one language (which is highly unlikely), they can find other opportunies in another country. Not only is there a bigger job market: It is easier to get a job in many fields of work by having the sought-after skill of speaking more than one language. On average, interpreters and translators make $44,190 per year, or $21.24 per hour. Most people enter this field of work with a bachelor's degree. <em>I'd say these are pretty good specs.</em>
<p>3. <span STYLE="font-style: italic">Travel can be a part of the job.</span></p>
<p> If you like to travel, well hey... it can be a part of the job! Eating new foods, seeing different trends and fashions, and learning foreign mannerisms can be fun. Traveling allows you to experience other cultures, gain a better world-view, and perhaps even make new friends (on your own time, of course).</p>
<p> Of course, where there are 'pros', there are 'cons' as well...</p>

<br><q>Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation and use of words involves a process of free creation. </q> <b>-Noam Chomsky</b></p></div>
